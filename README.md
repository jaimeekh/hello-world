# hello-world

Hello everyone!

I am Jaime, and I love creating data visualizations, along with doing the tedious and long processes of data cleaning and maintenance. It's satisfying and just engaging enough to be satisfying, but mindless enough to be easy to do forever. 

I love bok choy with soy sauce, silken tofu, burritos, and vegan grilled cheese with tomato soup.
